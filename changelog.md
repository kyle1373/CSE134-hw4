- Changed all fonts to scale with `em`. My previous portfolio website did not scale with size of screen well. This should fix it since it will work with all screen sizes.

- Added min width and min height for elements in about-me section, since it didn't seem to work well on mobile before.

- Made about-me picture at the top and the description at the bottom. This is to make it aesthetically more pleasing.

- Made about-me text scale with visual width so it gets bigger on larger screens.

- Made picture in about-me have a min width and min height, but it also scales too.

- Made github link at bottom to be smaller text size scaling with `em`

- Added underlines for pages to signify to the user where they are on the website.

- Added a projects page for the website navbar.

- Added an iframe for one of my biggest web / app projects in the projects page for users to look at and view.

- Fixed margins on navbar and footer to not scale with visual width but rather with a fixed `em` amount.

- Used a javascript library called `github-calendar` which displays my commit history in a calendar in the footer section along with my github. See https://github.com/Bloggify/github-calendar. I used github a lot, and it is a great way to show recruiters how actively I am contributing to the open source community.
