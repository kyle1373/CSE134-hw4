- Changed all fonts to scale with `em`. My previous portfolio website did not scale with size of screen well. This should fix it

- Added min width and min height for elements in about-me section, since it didn't seem to work well on mobile.

- Made about-me picture at the top and the description at the bottom. This is to make it aesthetically better.

- Made github link at bottom to be smaller text size scaling with `em`

- Added underlines for pages that the user is at on the navbar

- Added a projects page for the website navbar.

- Used a javascript library called `github-calendar` which displays my commit history in a calendar in the footer section along with my github. See https://github.com/Bloggify/github-calendar. I used github a lot, and it is a great way to show recruiters how actively I am contributing to the open source community.
