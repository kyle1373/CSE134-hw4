- Changed all fonts to scale with `em`. My previous portfolio website did not scale with size of screen well. This should fix it

- Added min width and min height for elements in about-me section, since it didn't seem to work well on mobile.

- Made about-me picture at the top and the description at the bottom. This is to make it aesthetically better.

- Made github link at bottom to be smaller text size scaling with `em`
